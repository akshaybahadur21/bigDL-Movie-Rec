# BigDL Movie Recommendation System üé¨

BigDL is a distributed deep learning library for Apache Spark; with BigDL, users can write their deep learning applications as standard Spark programs, which can directly run on top of existing Spark or Hadoop clusters.

- **Rich deep learning support:** Modeled after Torch, BigDL provides comprehensive support for deep learning, including numeric computing (via Tensor) and high level neural networks; in addition, users can load pre-trained Caffe or Torch models into Spark programs using BigDL.
- **Extremely high performance:** To achieve high performance, BigDL uses Intel oneMKL, oneDNN and multi-threaded programming in each Spark task. Consequently, it is orders of magnitude faster than out-of-box open source Caffe or Torch on a single-node Xeon (i.e., comparable with mainstream GPU).
- **Efficiently scale-out:** BigDL can efficiently scale out to perform data analytics at "Big Data scale", by leveraging Apache Spark (a lightning fast distributed data processing framework), as well as efficient implementations of synchronous SGD and all-reduce communications on Spark.

## Description üçø
In this project, you will implement, evaluate, operate, monitor, and evolve a recommendation service for a scenario of a movie streaming service. As in previous individual assignments, you work with a scenario of a streaming service with about 1 million customers and 27k movies (for comparison, Netflix has about 180 million subscribers and over 300 million estimated users worldwide and about 4000 movies or 13k titles worldwide)
